Generate a multiple-choice quiz with 30 questions covering the following topics:

Logical reasoning
- Number series (Give me a series and try to make me guess the next number according to a pattern, but don't tell me what the pattern is)
- Basic probability
- General logic concepts
// - Visual patterns (don't do that unless you can actually generate images and put them into the quiz)

Swift programming // Never use UIKit questions, just basic Swift
- Basic concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Swift fundamentals
- Design patterns

Swift design & UI/UX
- Basic design theory (color, typography, layout, etc.)
- Responsive & adaptive design in Swift
- Apple Human Interface Guidelines
- User-centered design principles
- Sketches, prototypes, wireframes, and interaction specifications

Rules for question generation:

Do not repeat any questions from the attached dataset. Ensure all questions are new and unique. Do not use markdown on your answers.
Mix the topics so that the test is varied (not grouped by subject).
Increase difficulty variety: Some questions should be medium, while others should introduce tricky choices ("trap answers") to encourage critical thinking.
Make answer choices realistic: Avoid obvious eliminations; create plausible incorrect answers.
Maintain topic balance: Distribute questions evenly across logical reasoning (exactly 6), Swift programming (exactly 12), and Swift design/UI/UX (exactly 12).
Format the output like this:

Question
[Insert the question]

Select one:
a. [Option 1]
b. [Option 2]
c. [Option 3]
d. [Option 4]

Repeat this format for all 30 questions. Make sure the questions are challenging, well-balanced, and thought-provoking. Be careful not to choose all alternatives the same letter, try to mix the answers. In almost 60% of your questions, the right alternative is B. It should be closer to 25% each one.

You are repeating a lot of questions from the annexed file. Make sure NOT to repeat any of them, but to create new original ones. And be careful on the amount of questions for each topic, make sure to balance as previously accorded.
