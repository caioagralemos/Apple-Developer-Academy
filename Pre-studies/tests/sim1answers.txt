8. d. The use of protocols and structs
9. b. 3
10. d. `var names: [String: Int] = []`
11. d. There is no built-in method, but you can compare the string with its reversed version.
12. b. To release resources or perform cleanup before the object is deallocated
13. d. It cannot be determined from the given information
14. b. Typecasting
15. c. The call to the function must be prefixed with the try keyword
16. b. Second
17. a. Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes
18. b. Using do-try-catch blocks
19. b. `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
20. b. 1/4
21. d. Any of the above, as long as it exits the current scope
22. b. It can only contain elements of a single, specified type
23. b. Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)
24. b. Polymorphism
25. c. `struct` instances are passed by value, and `class` instances are passed by reference
26. b. `var greeting = "hello"; greeting += ", world"`
27. c. A structure that repeats code a certain number of times
28. a. Using the `init` keyword followed by the initializer's parameters
29. b. var
30. a. The process of combining elements to create a new entity for the purpose of hiding complexity
31. c. To prevent strong reference cycles by creating a weak reference
32. b. A data type that allows you to group multiple values into a single compound value
33. d. There is no specific keyword; protocols only specify the required interface
34. d. Using a `repeat-while` loop
35. a. Open/closed principle
36. a. It can be called multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application
37. c. Both a and b
38. b. That the method or property belongs to the class itself, rather than any instance
39. d. Nothing can be deduced about the relationship between A and C
40. a. That the method can change the instance itself
41. a. The process by which the Swift compiler deduces the type of a variable or constant from its initial value
42. a. `true`
43. b. Immediately after the property's value is set
44. b. An optional that is automatically unwrapped whenever it is accessed
45. a. To delay the execution of code until the current scope is exited
46. a. 5 minutes
47. a. To indicate that a method, property, or subscript of a superclass is being overridden in a subclass
48. a. A self-contained block of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code
49. a. Dependency inversion principle
50. c. To define a named type with a finite set of cases
51. b. By using serial dispatch queues
52. a. To indicate that the closure can escape the function it is passed to and be called after the function returns
53. a. A form of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn from two given or assumed propositions (premises)
54. b. `var myVariable: Any`
55. b. Conditions that types must meet to conform to a protocol
56. b. Swift does not allow manual memory management; it uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)
57. a. Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them
58. c. Through protocol conformance
59. a. It unwraps an optional, or returns a default value if the optional is nil
60. a. They force you to exit a block of code if certain conditions are not met
