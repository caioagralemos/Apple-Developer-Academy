Here are the answers to your questions:

1. **b. Using the `if let` syntax** - This syntax safely unwraps an optional value.

2. **a. Singleton** - This pattern is used to create a single shared instance of a class.

3. **c. The needs and wants of the end-users** - User-centered design primarily focuses on the users' needs.

4. **c. Proposition** - A proposition is a statement that can be proven true or false.

5. **a. Adaptive design uses fixed layouts** - Adaptive design uses fixed layouts that match common screen sizes.

6. **b. let** - The `let` keyword is used to define a constant value.

7. **b. Encapsulation** - Encapsulation involves hiding the internal state of an object.

8. **b. To allow one object to perform actions on behalf of another object** - This is a common use of the Delegation pattern.

9. **b. To outline the basic structure and layout of a page** - Wireframes are used for outlining structure and layout.

10. **c. 13** - The sequence seems to be increasing by adding 4 more than the previous increment, making the next increment 13 (3 to 5 is +2, 5 to 9 is +4, so 9 to 13 is +4).

11. **a. To iterate over all cases** - The `CaseIterable` protocol allows for iterating over all cases in an enum.

12. **b. By ensuring there is sufficient contrast between text and background** - This is important for accessibility.

13. **c. Object** - An object is an instance of a class in object-oriented programming.

14. **d. It separates concerns, making the code more manageable** - MVC architecture is used for separating concerns.

15. **b. `==`** - This operator checks for equality.

16. **c. Media queries** - Media queries are used in responsive design to adjust styles based on screen size.

17. **b. A self-contained block of functionality** - A closure is a block of functionality that can be passed around in code.

18. **d. Maintain a consistent design language throughout the app** - This is essential in Human Interface Guidelines.

19. **a. Using `do-try-catch` blocks** - This is how Swift handles errors thrown by functions.

20. **b. To test design concepts and usability** - Prototypes are used for testing before finalizing a product.

21. **b. By using getters and setters** - This is how computed properties are defined.

22. **c. Inheritance** - Inheritance allows a class to inherit traits from another class.

23. **b. Deductive reasoning** - This type of reasoning argues from the general to the specific.

24. **b. It provides tailored layouts to specific devices** - This is an advantage of adaptive over responsive design.

25. **c. Extensions** - Extensions are used to add new functionality to existing types.

26. **b. To understand user needs and problems** - User interviews are conducted to understand users' needs.

27. **b

28. **b. The screen sizes at which the website layout changes** - Breakpoints are used in responsive and adaptive design for this purpose.

29. **a. Singleton** - This pattern is suitable for managing a shared resource.

30. **c. Sketches** - Sketches are typically the first step in the design process, used for initial ideas.
