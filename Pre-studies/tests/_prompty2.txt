Rules for question generation:

Do not repeat any questions from this dataset: [Attached]. Ensure all questions are new and unique.
Mix the topics so that the test is varied (not grouped by subject).
Increase difficulty variety: Some questions should be easy, while others should introduce tricky choices ("trap answers") to encourage critical thinking.
Make answer choices realistic: Avoid obvious eliminations; create plausible incorrect answers.
Ensure topic balance: The test should contain a fair mix of logic, Swift programming, and design-related questions.
Format the output like this:

Repeat this format for all 30 questions. Make sure the questions are challenging, well-balanced, and thought-provoking.
